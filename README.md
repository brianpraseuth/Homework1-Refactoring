For this homework assignment we were tasked with refactoring an existing web page that was built for a marketing company. Our tasks were to clean up the html semantics along with basically cleaning up the code to be more easily understood. 

The CSS file's ordering needed to be reorganized to make more sense to the html. There were also a lot of unnecessary css elements on their own that I grouped together which still made sense to the css without disturbing the page. 

Finally I went through both pages of code and attempted to rename and clean up as much as I could to make the final product more polished.
